Assignment 4: Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python
This repository contains solutions for Assignment 4 of the Python course, focusing on file handling, exceptions, and error management.

Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors
Functionality
The program tries to open a file named sample.txt.
If the file exists, it reads the file line by line and prints the contents.
If the file does not exist, it catches the error and prints:
Error: The file 'sample.txt' does not exist.
This ensures the program doesnâ€™t crash when the file is missing.

Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
Functionality
The program works with a file named output.txt.
Takes user input and writes it into the file (overwriting existing content).
Takes additional input from the user and appends it to the same file.
Finally, it reads the file again and displays the complete contents.
This demonstrates writing, appending, and reading from files.

How to Run
Clone this repository to your system.
Make sure Python is installed (Python 3 recommended).

Run the tasks using:
python task1.py
python task2.py
